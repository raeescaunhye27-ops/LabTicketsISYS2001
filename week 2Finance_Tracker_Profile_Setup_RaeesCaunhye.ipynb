This project collates many of the exercises from this week’s activities. This is intentional—by combining these exercises, you can reflect on your progress and see how well you’re following the industry best practices we espouse. These practices include:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Meaningful Notebook Naming:** Give your notebook a clear, descriptive name (e.g., `finance_tracker_profile_setup.ipynb`).\n",
        "- **Frequent Saves & Version Control:** Save your work often and use descriptive commit messages when uploading to GitHub.\n",
        "- **Descriptive Variable Names:** Use names like `user_name`, `theme_color`, etc., to clearly convey their purpose.\n",
        "- **Code Comments & Documentation:** Use text cells and inline comments to document your thought process.\n",
        "- **Critical Use of AI:** Ask follow-up questions if anything is unclear, and verify that AI suggestions align with the basics you’ve learnt (i.e., using input(), print(), basic data types, and variables).\n",

        "  Review your completed project and consider how collating these exercises helped you see your progress. Ask yourself if you’re following the best practices we discussed.\n",
        "\n",
        "  By completing all the steps in order, I can clearly see my progress from planning to implementation. Following a structured problem-solving method made the project feel manageable and organized. I am developing good habits such as planning before coding and writing readable code.\n",
        "- **Experiment:**\n",
        "  Try adding more inputs (like a secondary savings goal) or adjusting the output format.\n",
        "  To improve this project further, I could:\n",
        "\n",
        "Add a secondary savings goal.\n",
        "\n",
        "Ask the user for a monthly savings amount.\n",

        "Format the output differently (e.g., summary box style).\n",

        "Add simple validation (such as checking for empty input).\n",

        "  Post your project on GitHub with clear commit messages and share it with peers for feedback.\n",
        "  Posting this project on GitHub with clear commit messages demonstrates my understanding of both coding and documentation practices. Sharing it with peers can provide useful feedback and new ideas for improvement.\n",

        "  AI tools can help review pseudocode, improve wording, and clarify concepts. However, I will continue verifying that suggestions stay within the basics I have learned, especially using only input(), print(), and simple variables.\n",
